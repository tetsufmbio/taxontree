# TaxOnTree: Including taxonomic information in phylogenetic trees

## Determining the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

LCA of two or more organisms represents the most recent ancestor that all organisms in the set have in common.
Using phylogenetic methods, it is possible to estimate the date when an ancestor population has split apart and
initiated the speciation process, but we could also take advantage of a hierarchical classification of species to
verify how far the common ancestor of two or more species is. TaxOnTree uses this hierarchical classification to
determine the LCA between the organisms of query and subjects proteins. The hierarchical classification used by
TaxOnTree is taken from NCBI Taxonomy database. A short taxonomic lineage scheme from NCBI Taxonomy is represented
in the Figure S1. Each species has a taxonomic lineage divided in several taxonomic ranks, like family, order, class,
etc. To determine the LCA between two species we compare their taxonomic lineage and look for the lowest taxonomic
rank that both species share a common taxon. For example, LCA between human and mouse is superorder (Euarchontoglires),
while the LCA between human and frog is subphylum (Craniata). This simple comparison gives us information that LCA between
human and mouse is more recent than LCA between human and frog. 

## Taxonomic lineages and ranks

TaxOnTree also retrieves the taxonomic lineage of each taxon comprising the phylogenetic tree and uses this information to color the tree according to a taxonomic rank (See Coloring branches by a taxonomic rank). By using this resource, users can rapidly identify, for instance, the different families comprising the phylogenetic tree. However, two issues have to be considered whenever we use the taxonomic rank information from NCBI Taxonomy:

* Some taxonomic ranks are absent in a taxonomic lineage. For example, in the human lineage, there is no taxon for subclass, superclass, and subphylum (Figure S2);
* Some taxa found in a taxonomic lineage do not have a taxonomic rank. These taxa arereferred as “no rank”. For example, in the human lineage, Theria, Eutheria, Boroeutheria and others are taxa without rank (Figure S2).

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
